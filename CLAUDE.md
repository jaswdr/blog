# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is Jonathan's personal blog built with Hugo static site generator using the PaperMod theme. The blog features posts about AWS, development, machine learning, and various technical topics. It's deployed to AWS S3 and served at https://jaswdr.dev/.

## Architecture

- **Static Site Generator**: Hugo (located at `/sbin/hugo`)
- **Theme**: PaperMod (located in `themes/PaperMod/` as a submodule)
- **Configuration**: `config.yml` - main Hugo configuration with site settings, theme parameters, and social links
- **Content Structure**:
  - `content/posts/` - Blog posts in Markdown format
  - `content/projects.md` - Projects page
  - `content/tools.md` - Developer tools page
  - `content/search.md` - Search functionality page
- **Assets**: `static/` directory contains images, favicon, and other static assets
- **Custom Layouts**: `layouts/` contains Hugo template overrides and custom shortcodes
- **Post Archetype**: `archetypes/post.md` defines the template for new blog posts

## Common Commands

### Development
```bash
# Start development server
hugo serve

# Start development server with drafts
hugo serve -D
```

### Building
```bash
# Build the site for production
./scripts/build.bash

# Or run Hugo directly with production settings
hugo --baseURL https://jaswdr.dev --cleanDestinationDir --enableGitInfo --minify --noChmod --noTimes
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to AWS S3 (requires AWS CLI and blog-publisher profile)
./scripts/deploy.bash
```

## Content Management

### Creating New Posts
- Use Hugo's archetype system: `hugo new posts/post-name.md`
- Posts use YAML frontmatter with standard Hugo parameters plus PaperMod-specific settings
- All posts should include: title, date, tags, author, showToc, description
- Images for posts go in `static/posts/post-name/` directory

### Site Configuration
- Main configuration in `config.yml` uses YAML format
- Key sections: params (theme settings), menu (navigation), markup (syntax highlighting)
- Theme uses profile mode on homepage with custom image and social links
- Google Analytics and search functionality are enabled

### Theme Customization
- PaperMod theme is included as a submodule in `themes/PaperMod/`
- Custom layouts and shortcodes in `layouts/` directory override theme defaults
- Custom shortcodes include: audio, diagram, github, image

## File Structure Notes
- `public/` directory is generated by Hugo (don't edit manually)
- `static/images/` contains profile pictures and site assets
- Theme supports both light and dark modes (currently set to dark only)
- Site includes search functionality via Fuse.js integration
